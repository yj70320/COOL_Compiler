Good Job. Great Effort. Ride on to MP4 and keep going. Very soon we will hit the jackpot. I will see you on Tuesday. Have a great weekend. 



This project is for COSC375 Compiler Construction.

The goal is to write a compiler to translate COOL to MIPS.


mp1: lexer and parser
=========================================================================

testing:

compile lexer: make lexer

compile parser: make parser

run parser: ./lexer filename.cl |./parser

Good Job.

make filename.bc

make filename.s


mp3: code generation
=========================================================================

mp3: code generation

original zip file:
